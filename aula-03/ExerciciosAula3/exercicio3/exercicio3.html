    <p class="letra">A lonely road, crossed another cold state line<br>
      Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find<br>
      While I recall all the words you spoke to me<br>
      Can't help but wish that I was there<br>
      At where I'd love to be, oh, yeah<br>
      <br>
      Dear God, the only thing I ask of You<br>
      Is to hold her when I'm not around<br>
      When I'm much too far away<br>
      We all need that person who can be true to you<br>
      But I left her when I found her<br>
      And now I wish I'd stayed<br>
      <br>
      'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired<br>
      I'm missing you again, oh, no<br>
      Once again<br>
      <br>
      There's nothing here for me, on this barren road<br>
      There's no one here while the city sleeps<br>
      And all the shops are closed<br>
      Can't help but think of the times I've had with you<br>
      Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh, yeah
      <br>
      Dear God, the only thing I ask of You<br>
      Is to hold her when I'm not around<br>
      When I'm much too far away<br>
      We all need that person who can be true to you<br>
      But I left her when I found her<br>
      And now I wish I'd stayed<br>
      <br>
      'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired<br>
      I'm missing you again, oh, no<br>
      Once again<br>
      <br>
      Some search, never finding a way<br>
      Before long, they waste away<br>
      I found you, something told me to stay<br>
      I gave in to selfish ways<br>
      <br>
      And how I miss someone to hold<br>
      When hope begins to fade<br>
      <br>
      A lonely road, crossed another cold state line<br>
      Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Hey (oh, oh), yeah, yeah
